      Type "change attribute" to change input given for some "attribute". E.g., "change age", or "change destination"
      If there is no ambiguity then "change value" can work too where "value" was the input entered by user.
      E.g., in a pizza order you can say "change large" where "large" is a value for pizza size.
      If you also know the value you want to change to you can specify by saying, "change value to something",
      e.g., "change large to medium", or "change London to Paris" in a travel bot.
