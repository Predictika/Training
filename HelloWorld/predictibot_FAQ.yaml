# general questions about chatbots
- group:
  - q: what is conversational AI?
  - a: |
      Conversational AI combines technologies such as natural language understanding (NLP) and machine learning (ML)
      to power virtual agents that can converse with human users in natural language. These technologies power chatbots ands virtual
      agents such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri.

  - q: What is AI ?
  - q: Artificial Intelligence
  - a: |
        Artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines,
        in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals.
        In computer science AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents":
        any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
        Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions
        that humans associate with other human minds, such as "language understanding", "learning" and "problem solving

- group:
  - q: what chatbots can not do
  - q: are there tasks chatbots can not do
  - q: limits of chatbots
  - q: limitations of current chatbots
  - a: |
      The state of the art in AI is advancing rapidly so its always hard to characterize 'what is not possible".
      However as of 2019, it is safe to say that chatbots are successful only in narrow domains both from language understanding
      and problem solving. They are not capable of human-level intelligence for open-ended tasks or domains.
      It is not very hard to make a chatbot fail to understand some arbitrary utterance that a human would comprehend.
      However, well designed bots can support narrow business tasks quite well.

  - q: What are the benefits of chatbots to service providers
  - q: how can chatbots help my business
  - q: why should i deploy chatbots
  - q: why do i need chatbots for my business
  - a: |
      24x7, year round:  Chatbots can be used to provide 24x7, year-round support to your customers
      (including consumers, employees, business partners, and suppliers) without having to deploy large number of human agents in numerous call centers all over the world.
      Two-way communication:  Consumers can  talk to businesses with their questions, ask for help, or engage in more complex transactions.
      Conversely, business can reach out to consumers with updates, notifications, or loyalty building information and offers on a pro-active basis.
      Personalization: Chatbots often run on signed communication channels (e.g., FB Messenger, Slack, Skype).
      In such cases, businesses know who they are talking to and thus can personalize their responses to user questions or their own pro-active communications.
      Moreover, chatbots can preserve history of prior communication with a user and can thus personalize it based on user preferences, results of previous interaction, location, time of day, etc.
      Build once and deploy everywhere: Currently businesses have to create multiple competing technology-based solutions
      such as web sites, mobile apps, call centers, email etc, each with their own technologies and competing content challenges.
      With chatbots businesses can create one solution that can be deployed everywhere.
      Reduce cost: Once chatbots are developed they can be deployed at a tiny fraction of the cost of hosting call centers
      with human agents that can provide the same 24x7 coverage globally.
      The chatbots are usually hosted on cloud infrastructure and the cost of scaling them horizontally to manage varying load has come down drastically and is still on a downward curve.

- group:
  - q: Why will  consumers use Chatbots
  - q: how chatbots help my customers
  - q: how chatbots help my users
  - q: how will users use chatbots
  - a: |
      In addition to the benefits listed under the case for businesses, there are reasons why chatbots are attractive to consumers.
      Call center limitations: Current call centers run by human agents suffer from long delays, poor customer service, and limited hours.
      Chat programs preserve history:  Most chat communication program which support chatbots preserve the history of a user communication.
      Talking bots:  Speech understanding technology has matured enough that chatbots can engage users via speech input and not just via typed text.
      Reduced friction: Since users already spent more time inside messaging apps,
      the cost of switching between these apps and merchant-specific apps for business tasks increasingly creates friction.
      Single interface: No need to learn to juse apps or navigate on websites. Just express in natural language.

- group:
  - q: Why chatbots now
  - q: What will enable chatbots adoption
  - a: |
      2016 was a watershed year in the use of messaging apps such as FB Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat, SnapChat, Telegram, Skype, etc.
      More time was spent by users inside these apps than all other categories of apps combined.
      Many are calling this another paradigm shift in the use of computers: desktop, to internet, to mobile, and now messaging and direct communication.

  - q: How do bots compare with other digital technologies
  - q: chatbots comnpared with websites
  - q: chatbots compared with mobile apps
  - q: chatbots vs emails
  - q: chatbots vs marketing automation

  - a: |
      Other digital tools that connect businesses to users have increasingly serious limitations compared to chatbots.
      Websites are either tied to desktops and need high bandwidth to download their rich media pages.
      Mobile apps have not really succeeded beyond a small set of very popular apps – most of the business-specific and service provider apps have very low adoption.
      In fact according to one survey 70% of mobile app usage is restricted to 5 apps!!
      Email suffers from spam and lack of real-time communication.
      Digital adtech and Marketing automation is only one-way, mainly for marketing messages and increasingly suffers from ‘fake’ clicks.
      Telephones have been taken over by marketers and scam artists.
  - n: 16
- group:
  - q: Are chatbots only good for Q&A
  - q: Are chatbots only good for FAQ
  - q: can chatbots be used for more serious business tasks
  - a: |
      The first generation of chatbots have been developed for automatically answering questions from corporate FAQs, corpus of call center logs,  or from access to some search engine.
      Companies such as Predictika are developing technologies that will enable chatbots to support more complex business tasks
      such as sales lead qualification; online sales; product configuration, i.e., buying product and services that require multiple inter-dependent choices;
      business workflow such as automated sign-up and approval for services; business transactions
      such as online trading, banking, travel booking, service appointments; automated troubleshooting and diagnostic support; etc.

  - n: 17
- group:
  - q: How would you characterize different types of chatbots
  - q: classification of chatbots
  - a: |
      One classification that we find useful divides chatbots into at least following categories,
      though increasingly successful chatbots will combine ideas from more than one category.
      Chat for chat sake: As a social companion
      Bots for static text: Lookup FAQ or other text corpus to find closest match(es)
      Triggered Task Agents: Such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Siri
      Search: Language and speech wrapper around a search engine
      Complex task interactions: Enterprise chatbots that solve business tasks conversationally

  - q: Where is the AI in chatbots
  - q: where is the artificial intellgence in chatbots
  - q: does it  matter if chatbots have AI
  - q: where is machine learning in chatbots
  - q: where is NLP in chatbots
  - q: do you use NLP
  - q: do you use AI
  - a: |
      The AI in the chatbots is both in the front-end of interaction technologies and the back-end of reasoning, personalization, learning, and response generation.
      In order to go beyond simple keyword-based Q&A systems of the past, today’s chatbots are relying on more robust NLP technologies
      that use sophisticated parsing techniques based on learning from large corpus of sentences, classification of word usage and parts of speech, and automated relearning as new data comes in.
      Similarly, deep-learning multi-layer neural networks are able to understand spoken continuous speech
      that is speaker-independent and the proof is in the high quality shown by Alexa, Siri, Microsoft, and Google technologies that are becoming widely available.
      In the back-end one needs automated reasoning techniques such as Predictika’s constraint-based reasoning engine
      to manage complex tasks, machine learning for personalization and response generation, and again machine learning techniques
      to learn new concepts over time and assimilate different kinds of knowledge.
      So yes, AI is powering the chatbots today and will be needed even more over time as users demand
      increasingly more natural human-like interaction with these chatbots and businesses try to automate more complex tasks.

  - n: 19
- group:
  - q: What are the common business applications of chatbots
  - q: what are chatbots applications
  - a: |
      It is safe to say that chatbots are being built for every imaginable business task or function.
      This is so because chatbots help to automate a task and simplify communication between a business (or service providers)
      and their users (customers, employees, partners, suppliers). Still the common areas include the following.
      Sales, Marketing, Pre-Sales: Get product information, compare products, compare with competition
      Unassisted sales. Cross-sell. Up-sell. Renewals.
      Post sales Customer support.
      Automate other business tasks.

- group:
  - q: What is machine learning
  - q: What is ML
  - a: |
      Machine Learning is a branch of AI that includes a large set of techniques for inferring predictive problem solving models from data.
      Most ML techniques are 'supervised learning' where some human tags data which is then used to learn predictive models.
      There are some unsupervised learning techniques too but this is an area where lots more research is needed,
- group:
  - q: What is deep learning
  - q: what are multi layered neural networks
  - a: |
      Deep learning refers to a class of machine learning technologies that use multi-layer neural networks.
      These technoques have excellent results for variety of problems in image recognition, speech understanding, language translation,
      games of strategy, and many other problems where tagged data is available for training such neural network models.
      Most deep ML techniques are supervised but a few allow unsupervised learning.
- group:
  - q: how adaptive are chatbots
  - q: can chatbots learn
  - a: |
      Most chatbots use supervised machine learning techniques where a human developer has to create a corpus of tagged sentences to learn how to understanbd language.
      Someone monitors the use of the chatbots and when it fails, the chatbots are retrained offline and a new version is made available.
      Early research with unsupervised learning for chatbots has not been very successful as yet.
      Predictika technology is semi-supervised. Once a task model is developed, the training is done automatically without requiring
      a corpus of tagged sentences.

  - q: is artificial intelligence a threat to mankind
  - q: is AI a threat to human race
  - q: will computers replace humans
  - q: can computers replace humans
  - q: is AI a threat to our world
  - a: |
      At one level such questions have always been asked of any new and powerful technology (e.g., computers, television) and shown to be not so.
      AI, however, because it touches on human intelligence and with popular fiction around robots run amok generates more concern in this regard.
      As of 2019, while AI has made big strides, machines are not really close to mimicing human intelligence in any general sense.

  - a: |
      Predictika’s chatbots run on cloud-based servers such as those hosted by Amazon’s AWS.
      An enterprise customer can either use them via their AWS deployment or provide their own cloud-hosted environment.
      Enterprises can also run our chatbots in their private data centers.
      Predictika currently uses Docker-based containerization technology for rapid deployment and horizontal scaling.
      We should be able to support other public clouds such as by google, microsoft, or IBM on a custom basis.
  - n: 23
- group:
  - q: What technology does Predictika have for chatbots
  - q: what is the technology behind your chatbots
  - a: |
      At Predictika we recognized that this task complexity is very similar to the one solved by constraints-based configurators,
      first pioneered by Dr. Mittal at Xerox PARC and then successfully commercialized by him and his team at Selectica
      where they had successfully deployed their technology at major Global 100 companies such as IBM, GE, Cisco, Dell, Hitachi, Reliance, Walt Disney, Aetna, Blue Cross & Blue Shield companies, Firemen’s Fund, etc.
      Predictika has developed its own constraints-based, nested model configurator engine for automating complex tasks and directing the conversation in automating these tasks.
      Additionally, Predictictika has developed innovative ways to use the configurator models to guide the NLP processes
      that is much more effective than purely statistical NLP or generically trained grammars.

  - q: When is Predictika technology needed for chatbots
  - q: what is special about Predictika technology
  - q: what is your strength in chatbots
  - q: why should i use your technology
  - q: what is special about your technology
  - a: |
      Predictika technology is suitable for any business task that can be decomposed into multiple sub-tasks
      or decision steps where the tasks have some inter-dependencies and such dependencies can be expressed via local relationships or constraints.
      Examples include business workflow, food ordering, buying configurable goods and services
      such as cars, equipment, insurance policies, investment products, health plans, service contracts, etc.
      Predictika technology is also suitable for simpler tasks such as banking and other financial transactions,
      insurance claims,  service appointments, sales and marketing, etc where the task may not be intrinsically complex
      but the conversational setting brings new complexity.

- group:
  - q: Does Predictika use other third-party tools?
  - a: |
      Our philosophy is to only build where we truly bring some unique value add. We license everything else.
      We use wide array of open source tools for machine learning, speech, cloud deployment, chat widgets, etc.
      However, in many cases we leverage our own technology to get more out of other tools than might be possible for other developers without access to our technologies.
      For example, our configurator-based task models give us tremendous leverage in exploiting the NLP tools to give us much better accuracy in processing free flowing user requests in task areas that we support.

- group:
  - q: how long does it take to build a bot using Predictika tools
  - a: |
      The answer naturally depends on the scope of the project. We have built some pretty rich and complex bots in under a day.
      However, truly enterprise bots take time where the bulk of the time will go into reaching agreement on the scope,
      collecting the data needed to power the bot, and any integration with other enterprise tools.
      The actual time to model your task and train the grammar will be a very small fraction of the overall project.

      It will depend on what you want. However, in cases where we have compared against most other platforms, we can model the samne task
      in a very small fraction of the time. Often what takes weeks and months with opther platforms can be doine in hours and days with
      with Predictika tools.
      And we can provide much richer functionality out-of-the-box.

  - a: |
      As a company we have been working on conversational AI since 2016 and can summarize our key learnings.
      Once you model your business task, the bot can be quite robust.
      Our bots are normally augmented by static questions such as FAQs.
      It is very important that users can step outside the confines of a conversation and ask questions, change their mind,
      or even give extra information beyond what is expected.
      Human language is very rich and diverse. Same things or intent can be often expressed in many different ways.
      The bots will go thru a learning process as we gather data from interactions with real users.

# Qs on comparing us with others
- group:
  - q: what is your elevator pitch
  - q: what is unique about Predictika
  - q: what is unique
  - q: what is your USP
  - a: |
      Chatbots that support enterprise grade business tasks need to be very flexible in their interaction flow and conversational capabilities.
      Predictika excels in both aspects. Our Constraints-based Dialog Engine allows you to easily model rich complex tasks.
      Our model-based NLP trainer allows the same thing to be expressed in a large number of ways without needing to be trained on each instance.
      Our Dialog Engine maintains full context, allowing the users to change their mind and revise their work with minimal re-entry.
      Our multi-agent architecture allows the users to ask questions even in the middle of a conversation with the bot.
- group:
  - q: how much custom programming is needed
  - q: do i need to program in python, node.js, or other programning languages
  - q: do i need to program in python
  - q: do i need to program in node.js
  - q: do i need to program in other programning languages
  - a: |
      The only time you need to write ANY custom code is for connecting our chatbots with your back-end legacy systems.
      The actual chatbot task model or the NLP training requires ZERO custom programming.
      When you do need to interface our chatbots to your legacy systems, we use python programming language.
- group:
  - q: do you have a graphical dialog builder
  - q: how easy is it to describe dialog using Predictika
  - q: how do i describe dialog
  - q: how do i model the dialog
  - a: |
      We dont have a graphical dialog builder largely because dialogs for business tasks cannot really be described graphically.
      We use YAML as the language in which you can describe your task models. Thus even the most complex dialogs can be modeled
      using our modeling language and expressed in a YAML file.

      Google Dialog Flow (formerly api.ai) is a popular open source platform for conversational interfaces.
      Their key strength is training the system from highly annotated sample sentences to recognize intent and extract intents.
      Their key weaknesses, which we fix: Task dialog has to be hard coded in your favorite language, leading to long development time
      and very rigid dialogs. Training from example sentences is very tedious and has convergence issues
      There is also no support for voice inpout, graphical chat interface, or context management.
