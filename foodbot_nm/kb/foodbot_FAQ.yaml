  - q: do you have any gluten free options

  - q: do you have gluten free choices

  - a: |
      Yes! Delicious gluten-free pizza made with Udi's® Certified Gluten-Free crust.
      Select Pizza Hut® Gluten-Free toppings. For those simply looking to reduce gluten in their diets,
      we offer a create-your-own option but it is NOT prepared using the procedures certified by the Gluten Intolerance Group (GIG).
      The create-your-own option is made with Udi's® certified gluten-free crust and the cheese, pepperoni
      (if selected) and marinara from the gluten-free kit, but any other toppings selected in addition to these come
      from the make table where all toppings are stored. These create-your-own pizzas (along with the GIG certified pizzas)
      are freshly baked- to-order on parchment paper in our oven.
      In addition to these techniques, team members who make either your create-your-own option or
      a Cheese-only or Pepperoni Gluten-Free Pizza wear gloves and even use a designated gluten-free pizza roller
      cutter to cut the pizzas. Most standard Pizza Hut® toppings are naturally gluten free, however
      meatballs, Sauce Drizzles and Crust Flavors are excluded due to gluten content and possible cross-contamination.

  - q: pizza dough?
  - q: What is  Dough made of
  - q: what is dough made of

  - a: |
      Pizza Hut got its start in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas, the nation's top wheat-producing state.
      We have harvested wheat for our original dough recipes from some of the same family-run wheat
      fields and have worked with some of the same flour-making mills for decades.
      Just like artisan bakeries, we believe in taking the extra bread-making step to allow our dough to sit
      undisturbed in heated proofers to allow our famous and original Pan dough to rise perfectly for
      optimal flavor and texture. It's an investment in time and money, but one we believe is well worth it.

  - q: is pizza dough made with eggs
  - a: |
      Real pizza dough does not contain eggs, but some of the cheaper places and also some of the frozen ones
      do (for texture purposes, because they skimped on time, a very important factor).
      Always ask, making clear you have an allergy.
