              Welcome to the predictika demo foodbot. It is based on the menu of a national fast food pizza chain.
              You can type general greetings such as "hi" to get general information.
              Or you can type "start" to be guided to place your order.
              Or simply describe in your words what you want. You can say,
              "i want large hand tossed pizza with onions mushrooms, drinks, pasta and desserts"
